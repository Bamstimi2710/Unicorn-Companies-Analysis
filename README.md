# Unicorn-Companies-Analysis
## Introduction
The aspiration for any tech startup is to attain a valuation surpassing one billion dollars ($1 billion), earning them the coveted status of a Unicorn. A Unicorn company is a startup valued at over $1 billion without being publicly traded. These companies are particularly appealing to investors, offering the potential for substantial returns on investment due to their impressive valuations.

This repository includes SQL queries and accompanying visual results for the analytical project focused on 1062 unicorn companies across 46 countries globally.
## Objectives
This project was aimed at exploring the answers to the questions as requested by [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=unicorn) alongside answering other questions using SQL queries.

The Questions are as follows;
1.	How many countries have made it to the Unicorn?
2.	Which Unicorn Company had the biggest return on investment?
3.	How long does it take for a Company to become a Unicorn?
4.	Which industries have the most unicorns?
5.	Which countries have the most unicorns?
6.	Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
7.	How many Companies founded in Africa made it to becoming a Unicorn according to the datasets?
8.	Which Company is Most Valued?
9.	Analyze the country and year with the most Unicorns
## Data Sourcing
While searching for various datasets online, I stumbled upon the Unicorn Company Datasets, recalling a challenge by Maven Analytics that I had missed months ago. Inspired to take a unique approach, I decided to do something different with these datasets.
## About the Datasets
The dataset used in this analysis contains 1062 rows, and the data dictionary gives us a description of each field names in order to understand the datasets provided. The Field and their respective descriptions are provided below:
